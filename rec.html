	<h1>Recipes - World's best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
	<p>I’ve been making scrambled eggs since my father taught me at 10 years old so I like to think I’ve been perfecting them for over 20 years! When it comes to scrambled eggs, I look for the eggs to be soft and creamy.

Use a nonstick pan and a silicone spatula — When scrambling eggs, we use a high-quality nonstick pan. I also love using my silicone spatula since the flexibility lets me swirl and sweep the eggs as they cook.

I only use eggs, butter, and salt to make scrambled eggs — no milk or cream! I’ve never understood why people add extras like milk, cream, and even sour cream to eggs before cooking them. Milk and sour cream water scrambled eggs down and to us, the cream is just unnecessary.
